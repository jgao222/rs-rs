# Resolution Switcher
A simple tray icon menu for changing the screen resolution in Rust.

Using [windows-rs](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs) and [tray-item](https://github.com/olback/tray-item-rs).
- Supports Windows only

## Functionality
The program filters to only display resolutions that are 60fps with default fixed output.
Otherwise, there would be too many to list.
